## 1b. 5 elements from the Physical Space of the classroom 
In the 9th grade ELA classroom, there’s a smartboard connected to the teacher’s laptop. Social media is also used as a reference, which obviously revolves around technology. There is a printer, a microphone/camera setup, and the room’s router(?) hanging from the ceiling. There are also outdated monitors on the side of the room. The walls are mostly barren, with minimal postings on the bulletin board and whiteboards on each side of the smartboard. Students are grouped by 2 desks per cluster facing eachother. The students can read from the contents of the smartboard.  

## 1c. 5 elements of the Sociocultural Space of the classroom 
The demographic of the class seemed to have a slightly higher ratio of girls over boys. It is assumed that they are all around the same age (14-15) for 9th grade. They mostly appear to be asian, regardless of gender. Some of the students raise their hands, while others yell out answers to the teacher in hopes of being the fastest to respond. The teacher seems to prefer introducing content and teaching gently, as opposed to yelling or calling certain students out. She also tries to be relatable and realistic by giving user examples or keeping it real and herself approachable by saying things like "you’re my last class" or "let’s get this Friday over with". A clear set of procedures for the assignment was listed on th

## 1d. 2 from the elements of Physical Space and 2 from the elements of Social Space 
In this age, technology is unquestionably required for teachers at any level of experience to know how to use and ideally master. For example, in order to teach my stem courses this year, I connected my laptop to the smart board or TV just like the teacher in the video so I could project content as well as provide live demonstrations for lessons. Because my kids also all had their own laptops, they could follow along with my instructions. I saw the value in the classroom setup, since for the assignment in the video students would pair up for discussion so preset desk clusters seemed like a wise option to take some of the guesswork out for them in order to get down to business. This type of setup also can sometimes provide leverage for a teacher to have a sense of management over the class in terms of being able to get them to communicate with eachother if the activity requires it. I also would prefer to use psychological tactics like desk alignment or predetermined grouping to manage a classroom because they don’t involve yelling or beratement. Being prepared with a concrete lesson plan like this teacher did is the wisest and most dilligent/responsible thing a teacher can possibly have as a routine, especially if they are not strong in improvisation.

## 2a. Curriculum Interview 
The teacher wanted to choose images that would be interesting enough to engage the students, so what she chose must have been thought-provoking enough to her standards. She felt that adding the Instagram roleplay component was enough to grab the students’ attention, and wanted them to be able to understand the historical context of the book they were covering from a modern lens.

## 2b. Post-Interview 
The teacher believed she communicated adequately to the students the point and expectations of the lesson by discussing it with them that day. She believed that they were able to best learn from the experience by motivating them with the social media factor, which got them interested enough to 'lock-in' to the lesson. As stated previously, she used the desk setup to manage the class as well as preparing for the lesson beforehand. She also made the plan for the lesson clear and concise enough for them to understand that there was a specific purpose for being on their phones, and hoped that this clarity would prevent them from distractions despite having their phones out. It seemed like students were highly engaged due to the prompt to use social media to integrate lesson concepts with relation to their modern lives.

## 2c. Statement from each of the interviews 
During the first interview, the teacher stated that adding the Instagram component would make the students a lot more engaged than they would have been in the lesson without it. In the post-interview, I like that she mentioned how students were able to relate the lesson topic with their own lives, and how she was able to "see into their worlds" by using social media as a way to distribute a classroom task.  

## 3a. Two examples of Danielson's components 
* 2b: At 9:13, the teacher encourages students to have questions about each ‘post’ prepared as she explains the assignment. She also answers a student’s questions about the technicalities of the task at 11:52, and does it by approaching the student’s desk area to actively listen to their concerns and passionately explain what needs to be done.  
* 2d: At 7:16, you can see the teacher struggling to not be talked over by the students. The collective volume steadily rises, and you can see conversations happening in the background which aren’t necessarily picked up from the teacher’s microphone. At 7:40, she voices her displeasure by mentioning to the class that she can’t hear a student speaking, implying that they’re too loud. This is slightly effective, as that student can be heard by the viewer after a couple seconds.  
* 3d: At 53:46, the teacher asks the class what’s so funny and to explain what’s happening after the discussions and assignment tasks wrap up. She prods the collective thoughts to figure out why they were laughing so much, and how it applied to what they were learning. Then, at 56:22 she chooses a student to present what they ‘posted’ to their instagram page and to explain why it’s relevant to the discussion. 

## 3b. Justification of examples (see 3a) 


## 4a. Student Engagement
Despite the overall little respect the students showed the teacher, it seemed like they were engaged due to using Instagram to frame their experience with the lesson’s content for To Kill a Mockingbird analysis. They seemed excited to roleplay as users responding to images or events related to the content from the lecture.

## 4b. Teaching Style
While I mostly liked the teacher’s gentle style in the classroom, I do think she could have been ever so slightly more assertive. This would make it easier for her to lead the lesson smoothly and garner the rightful amount of respect from students.

## 4c. My Goals 
After watching this lesson, I have several thoughts. While I would like students to enjoy themselves and be able to take something from each topic, the slight doormattedness of the teacher reminded me that I should also aspire to improve the quality of my classroom management. It also inspired me to think more unorthodoxly about how I can get classes to engage more.
